## The Harry Potter Directory

is a project created with the intention of keeping track of each character for newcomers to the Harry Potter series. The website displays information on several characters such as their nickname, house, spell, the use of that spell, and the names of their children.

The site has built in interactivity that allows the user to add to the directory as they continue on their Happy Potter watching journey in order to keep track of all of the characters tht they would like to. Once the directory is up and running, you can see a list of all of the characters and the listings under them by visiting the db.json file [here](http://localhost:3000/characters) while the servers are up and running. The db.json file is local to the application in order to manipulate and access the information.

This project is a representation of how the languages we have learned about in the software engineering program can communicate to eachother and be used to make a SPA <!-- Single Page Application --> that a user can benefit from.

When the SPA is opened, the home screen is one that displays over 25 characters that can all be clicked on to display more information about the clicked-on character.
